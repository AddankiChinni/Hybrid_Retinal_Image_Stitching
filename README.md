# Hybrid_Retinal_Image_Stitching:
• Built a CNN–Transformer hybrid (TranSegNet) for multi-retinal image stitching, achieving PSNR
≈30dB,SSIM≈1andpixelerror <10pxinFIRES&Acategoriesusing advanced preprocessing
and homography-based feature alignment.
• Designed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline with CNN feature extraction, Transformer global
reasoning, and accurate homography estimation to generate seamless stitched retinal panoramas.
